REMIND version 3.0 for AmigaDOS

I DO NOT SUPPORT REMIND ON AmigaDOS.  THE AmigaDOS PORT HAS NOT BEEN MAINTAINED
FOR QUITE A WHILE.

REMIND is a sophisticated alarm/calendar program.  Details are given
in the man page, "remind.1".

1 - Read the file COPYRIGHT.

2 - cd src; examine the files config.h and custom.h and adjust parameters
    as needed

3 - If you are using SAS/C to compile Remind, type:

	copy amiga-SCOPTIONS SCOPTIONS
	smake -f smakefile

This will create remind, which is ready to be executed.

[Please note:  I CANNOT SUPPORT THE AMIGA VERSION!]

See README.UNIX for more info.
