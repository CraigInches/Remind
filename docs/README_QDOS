REMIND version 3.0.18 for QDOS / SMSQ

REMIND is a sophisticated alarm/calendar program.  Details are given
in the documentation file, "remind_doc" (QUILL format).
[Note from David Skoll -- I was not sent the file `remind_doc', so
 you're on your own here.  You'll have to use the UNIX man pages.]

1 - Read the file COPYRIGHT.

2 - Change to the directory "src"

3 - Examine the Makefile and change any parameters which need to be
    changed for your system.  (The makefile for QDOS / SMSQ is
    makefile_QDOS).

4 - Examine the files config_h and custom_h and adjust parameters as needed

5 - Examine lang_h and choose the language you want Remind to use.
    There has no effort been put in making the language modules working
    on the QL.  You'll have to adjust the files for yourself to get
    them working (umlauts etc).

6 - Execute "make;'-fMakefile_QDOS'".  Be sure, that your DATA_DEFAULT
    directory is the directory where the remind source files are
    placed.

See README.UNIX for some more information about Remind.

RELEASE NOTES -- miscellaneous info that couldn't go anywhere else!

The QDOS / SMSQ version does not support the enhanced features of
the UNIX and/or OS/2 versions.

I had some problems with the sunrise() and sunset() functions,
but didn't examine it.

I've ported Remind on a SMSQ/SGC system.  It should work on other
systems without problems.  The compiler used was C68 v4.14c.

Remind should work with each QL or compatible with 512K or more RAM.
It'll however NOT work on a standard QL due to it's code size.

Any problems with the QDOS / SMSQ versions should be sent to:
