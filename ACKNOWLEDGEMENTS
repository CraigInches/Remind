I would like to thank the following people:

Bill Aten <netagw!bill@uunet.UU.NET> for providing remind-all.sh

Bradley D. Keister <keister@poincare.phys.cmu.edu>, Rhys Weatherly
rhys@batserver.cs.uq.OZ.AU> and Anthony Cheng for initially providing
the Turbo C compiler support.

Dennis Cottel <dennis@peanuts.nosc.mil> for providing the patch to
produce calendars by weeks as well as by months.

Bill Silvert <bill%biomel@cs.dal.ca> and Dennis Cottel
<dennis@peanuts.nosc.mil> for suggesting many of the new features in
REMIND.

Dave Wolfe <dwolfe@pffft.sps.mot.com> and Raphael Manfredi
<ram@eiffel.com> for noticing bugs and sending me fixes.

Dave Rickel and George M. Sipe for sample reminders and holidays.

Michael Salmon for ISO encoding of PostScript output.

Darrel Hankerson for helping me provide some OS/2 support.  Sorry
it's not complete, Darrel!

Phillipp Slusallek for suggesting the -k option.

Amos Shapir, David W. Tamkin and Frank Yellin for help with the Hebrew
calendar.

All of the language translators whose names are listed in lang.h

Mark Harrison and Michael McLennan for the excellent book
"Effective Tcl/Tk Programming".  This is where I stole the source
for Tcl/Tk tabbed notebooks, and is an excellent reference book.
Thanks also to Lucent Technologies and Addison Wesley Longman for
making it legal to steal the code.

All others who have corresponded with me to report bugs, express
appreciation or suggest features - too many people to list here.

Finally, all those who donated money to support the production of
REMIND.  Your donations were gratefully appreciated.
