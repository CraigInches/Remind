MICROSOFT WINDOWS

I used to prohibit porting Remind to Microsoft Windows.  However, this
may cause problems with the GPL, so I have removed that restriction.

Although I cannot prevent you from porting Remind to Windows, I appeal
to you not to do it.  I am trying to encourage the growth of free
software, not proprietary software.

If you port Remind to Windows, I will not provide support or answers to
questions -- you're on your own.  On the other hand, I will feel no guilt
in taking enhancements and merging them into the UNIX stream.
