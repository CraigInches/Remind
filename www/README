HTML Hebrew Calendar Server

This is a very rudimentary Hebrew calendar server for the WWW.  It supplies
local sunrise and sunset times, moon phases, upcoming Jewish holidays,
and PostScript calendars.

To install it, you need the Remind package, available via ftp from
ftp://ftp.doe.carleton.ca/pub/remind-3.0.  You should install Remind,
setting the lattitude, longitude, location and time zone as appropriate
for your machine.

Once you have Remind installed, follow these steps to set up your WWW server.

1) Unpack all of the files into a convenient directory

2) edit "cal_dispatch" as instructed in the comments at the beginning
   of the file.

3) Do "grep -i HREF *" to find all the hypertext links.  Edit them
   to point to the proper place on your system.  The links should be
   set as follows:

	http://your.system.name/your_bin_name/cal_dispatch?what

   Where "what" is one of:
	sunrise, sunset, hebdate, calps, moon or hebps.

   You must have the ability to execute cal_dispatch from within your
   WWW server; consult your system administrator for details/permission.

4) Do "grep -i ottawa *" to find all references to "Ottawa" in the
   scripts.  Change them as appropriate for your location.

5) TEST ALL YOUR LINKS THOROUGHLY

6) Enjoy!
